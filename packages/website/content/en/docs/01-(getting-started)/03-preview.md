Choose **File → Open…** to open a React composition (`.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.js`). Select an asset, track, or clip to inspect its details.

> [!NOTE]
> **Your source is your canvas**
> Edit the composition in your text editor. Celesta previews and exports it; save the source to update the preview.

Compositions reload when you save. You can also choose **File → Reload** to reload manually.

## Listen as you look

Playback synchronizes the picture and audio. Use waveforms and track levels to check timing, mute or solo tracks to isolate a sound, and adjust the preview volume. Drag along the timeline ruler to scrub to a specific moment.

## Debug guides

`<DebugOverlay />` outlines a safe area, shades the canvas outside it, and marks the center point, and `<DebugBounds>` outlines a group of layers. They appear in the Celesta preview, and in PNG frames and contact sheets exported with `--debug-guides`, but never in a video, so you can leave them in while you work. `useDebugGuides()` tells your own components when guides are drawn.

## Find a layer's source

Click a layer in the preview to select it. An orange outline marks it, and the **React Preview** panel shows a **Layer** section with its ID and where it was written. **Source** gives the element nearest the layer, such as a `<Rect>` in `Title.tsx`, as its name and `file:line:column`. **Called from** lists the elements around it, from the nearest outward, such as the `<Title>` that renders it and the `<Sequence>` it sits in. Click any row to open that position in your text editor. Click an empty part of the canvas to clear the selection.

A layer is hit anywhere inside the box it is drawn in, including transparent pixels of an image and the gaps between glyphs. A `<Rect>` with a stroke and no fill is hit only on its stroke, so you can select what is inside an outline. Where layers overlap, the one drawn last wins. Selection is available when you open a React composition; a layer that is not in the frame being shown reads **Not in this frame**. Reloading the composition clears the selection.

Celesta opens the position in the editor named by the `VISUAL` environment variable, then `EDITOR`. It can include arguments, such as `code -n`. On macOS and Linux, Celesta also asks your login shell for them when the app does not have them, such as when it was started from the Dock or Finder, so variables set in your shell profile still apply. VS Code (`code`), Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Sublime Text, JetBrains IDEs, and TextMate open at the line and column; other editors are passed `+line file`. With neither variable set, the file opens in your system's default application, without a position.

Editors that run inside a terminal, such as `vim`, `nano`, and `emacs -nw`, cannot be started from the app. Celesta shows a message instead; set `VISUAL` to a graphical editor.
